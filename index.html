		<h2>Pictures</h2>
		<p>
			This is what a normal website made by me would look like you can have as much text and as many pictures as u want, as long as you supply the pictures as a link!

        <p>Here i will show u i can place links these links can be what ever you want them to be for example: your youtube; your twitch; your instagram; your twitter or anything else you want!</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com">Youtbe</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitch.tv">Twich</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com">Instagram</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What can it be about?</h2>

        <p>well i think my pages are usualy best for content creators who want a place to have all their links like a shop link for example as my websites are hosted through github unless you own the domain u want. If not then, unfortunately, it will always show my github name in the link</p>
